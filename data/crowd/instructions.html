    <p style="color:red;"><b>Note: If you have done this task earlier, we have changed the instructions for this batch. 
    So please make sure to read the instructions.</b></p>
    
    <p>In this task, imagine a user who wants to find information online and unintentionally asks a search system (like Google or Siri) an ambiguous search query. 
    To better understand their (unspecified) search intention, the system asks a clarifying question.</p>
    
    <p><u>For example</u>, a user may be looking for an anti-spyware program called Defender and may ask <i>"Tell me about defender"</i>. 
    However, the query is ambiguous: the word "defender" may refer to many things: a TV series ‘The Defender’, a vehicle named ‘Defender’ and so on.</p>
    
    <p> Perhaps the system may guess that the user is looking for the TV series, and asks: <i>"Are you interested in a television series?"</i></p> 
      
    <p> Now, the user may answer the question in many ways. 
    It can be as simple as <i>“No.”</i> or a longer <i>“No, I am looking for the computer program Defender.”</i> depending on the user’s personal preferences.</p> 
     
    <p> <b>The goal of this task</b> is to evaluate the relevance and naturalness of answers to these clarifying questions. 
    You will be given the (possibly ambiguous) search query, the user’s search intent (which is invisible to the search system) and the clarifying question. 
    For each question, you will receive a few user responses which may or may not answer the question.
    </p>
    
    <u>Your goal is to assign Naturalness and Relevance scores (in the range 1-5) for each answer.</u>
      
    <h2> Relevance </h2>
    
    <p> The Relevance of an answer measures whether the answer is aligned with the user’s search intent. 
    <b>In other words, it helps the search system better understand the user’s unspecified intention. </b>
    An answer that is perfectly aligned with the intent should receive a relevance score of 5. 
    An answer that contradicts the search intent or discusses unrelated topics should receive a relevance score 1.
    </p>
      
    <p><u>In the above example</u>, both <i>“No.”</i> and <i>“No, I am looking for the computer program Defender.”</i> perfectly capture the user’s unspecified intention and should receive a relevance score of 5. 
    Answers such as <i>“Yes.”</i>, <i>“I am interested in the television series.”</i> or <i>“I didnt know defender was a TV series”</i> should receive a relevance score of 1 because they have no connection to the user’s original search intent (i.e. the anti-spyware program).
    </p>
      
      <h2> Naturalness </h2>
      <p> The Naturalness of an answer rates whether the answer is fluent, grammatical, and human-like. 
      A perfectly natural answer could have been written by a reasonably fluent English speaker, and does not provide information beyond what the question is asking for. 
      Such answers would receive a naturalness score of 5. 
      An unnatural answer might have logical errors in them, or perhaps be impossible to understand. 
      Such answers would receive a naturalnes score of 1.
      </p>
      
      <p> <u>In the above example</u>, both <i>“No.”</i> and <i>“No, I am looking for the computer program Defender.”</i> would  receive a naturalness score of 5. 
      Answers such as <i>“Yes, I am looking for the computer program.”</i> or <i>“No, I am looking for the television series”</i> would receive naturalness scores of 1. 
      Recall that the user wants to find a computer program and the search system asked if they were looking for a television series, and no reasonable user would have written the above answers. 
      </p> 
      
      <p> Note that while the answer <i>“Yes, I am looking for the computer program.”</i> is not natural, it can help the search system understand the user’s intent and would receive a high relevance score. </p> 
      <p> In terms of grammatical, please ignore mistakes caused by cases and "'", for example, do not take points off for using "im" for "I'm". </p>
        
        <h2>Differences between Relevance and Naturalness</h2>
        <p> Note that relevance and naturalness are not dependent. </p>
        <p> If an answer is aligned with the user's search intent, but does not answer what the question is asking for, then it is relevant but not natural. </p>
        <p> If an answer is a possible answer for the clarifying question, but contradicts the user's search intent, then it is natural but irrelevant. For example, for a yes-no question, both yes or no could be natural, but at least one of them must be irrelevant.</p>
        
      <h2> Examples </h2>
      <p>Here are some examples with explanations:</p>
      <p><b><u>Example 1:</u></b> The clarifying question matches the search intent</p>
      <ul>
            <p><b>Search intent: </b>"Anti-spyware program Defender"</p>
            
            <p><b>User Query:</b> "Tell me about defender"</p>
            
            <p><b>Clarifying question:</b> “Are you interested in the software Defender"</p>
            
            <p><b>✔ Good answers:</b></p>
            <ul>
                  <li>“Yes”</li>
                  <li>“Yes, that is what I need”</li> 
                  <li>“The anti-spyware program” </li> 
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>✘ Bad answers:</b></p>
            <ul>
                  <li>“No” <i>(Explanation: This answer contradicts with the user's search intent, so it is bad because it has low relevance. However, it is actually natural because it can be otherwise true.)</i></li>
                  <li>“I don’t know”  <i>(Explanation: This is neither relevant nor natural, because the user should know and answer “yes”)</i></li> 
            </ul>
      </ul>
      
      <p><b><u>Example 2:</u></b> The clarifying question is relevant but does not match the search intent</p>
      <ul>
            <p><b>Search intent:</b> "anti-spyware program Defender"</p>
            
            <p><b>User Query:</b> "Tell me about defender"</p>
            
            <p><b>Clarifying question:</b> "are you interested in the television series Defender"</p>
            
            <p><b>✔ Good answers:</b></p>
            <ul>
                  <li>“No”</li> 
                  <li>“No that is not what I am looking for”</li> 
                  <li>“No i want troubleshooting information for windows defender the software”</li> 
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>✘ Bad answers:</b></p>
            <ul>
                  <li>“Yes, that is what I want” <i>(Explanation: No, it is not what the user wants, it contradicts with the search intent. It is natural but not relevant)</i></li>
                  <li>“I don’t know”  <i>(Explanation: Because the user should know it. This is neither natural nor relevant)</i></li> 
            </ul>
      </ul>
      
            
      <p><b><u>Example 3:</u></b> The clarifying question is not a well-formed clarifying question</p>
      <ul>
            <p><b>Search Intent:</b> "Find vendors that sell computer memory upgrades."</p>
            
            <p><b>User Query:</b> "memory"</p> 
            
            <p><b>Clarifying question:</b> “who was the first to study the brain and memory” </p>
      
            <i>Note that the clarifying question is irrelevant to the user’s query.</i>
            
            <p><b>✔ Good answers:</b></p>
            <ul>
                  <li>“It is not related to my search”</li>
                  <li>"I don’t know”</li> 
                  <li>“Don’t ask me”</li> 
            </ul>
            
            <p><b>✘ Bad answers:</b></p>
            <ul>
                  <li>“Hermann Ebbinghaus” <i>(Explanation:  literally answering the question asked by the system. This is bad because it is unnatural to do so when the user is the one searching for information.) </i></li> 
                  <li>“Yes”/“No” <i>(Explanation: yes or no cannot be used to answer these questions)</i></li> 
            </ul>

            <p>Now, please imagine the following search scenario and score Answer 1~4 in terms of their relevance and naturalness in the range of 1-5. </p>
            <p>One of the answers always copies user's search intent. 
            In terms of relevance, it is perfect. 
            However, it may not serve as the most natural answer to the clarifying question.
            <b> So, please rate its relevance and naturalness carefully, because it will be used for attention check on your works!</b></p>
            
            <p>Also, sometimes two answers can be the same, make sure to give the same scores if that happens.
